Reimplement the RUSA ACP controle time calculator with flask and ajax

## ACP controle times

That's "controle" with an 'e', because it's French, although "control"
is also accepted.  Controls are points where   
a rider must obtain proof of passage, and control[e] times are the
minimum and maximum times by which the rider must  
arrive at the location.   

## AJAX and Flask reimplementation

The current RUSA controle time calculator is a Perl script that takes
an HTML form and emits a text page. The reimplementation will fill in
times as the input fields are filled.  Each time a distance is filled
in, the corresponding open and close times should be filled in.
